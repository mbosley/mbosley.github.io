- Measuring the Effect of Legislative Rule Change on Obstruction in the British House of Commons, 1800-2000.
  + I use Item-Response Theory (IRT) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to
    measure the prevalence of obstruction in a corpus of over one million
    legislative speeches. With this measure, I investigate whether rules that
    limit the ability of legislators to obstruct represent /new/ restrictions on
    behavior, or whether they are codifications of existing informal norms.
