-   [Measuring the Effect of Legislative Rule Change on Obstruction in the British House of Commons, 1800-2000](bosley_methods_minor_paper.pdf) (early draft)
    -   I will use Item-Response Theory (IRT) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to
        measure the prevalence of obstruction in a corpus of over one million
        legislative speeches. With this measure, I investigate whether rules that
        limit the ability of legislators to obstruct represent *new* restrictions on
        behavior, or whether they are codifications of existing informal norms.
